- 👋 Hi, I’m @MajesticSunBear
- 👀 I’m interested in Science and Technology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning VB.NET, SQL, C/C++
- 💞️ I’m flying solo while I am still soaking in the basics
- 📫 How to reach me ...

  I am a biotech worker and over the years I have absorbed as much knowledge from the people around me.  My first foray was toying around with VBA in Excel to help organize random reports.
  Last year I moved into a QC role and I am constantly interacting with sampling automation, custom readout displays, and hotkeys that do half the job for us.
  I have always learned the most from breaking the scripts I use on the daily to get a better understanding.
  I have put off learning how to code for too long and I hope to learn many new things and help my team in more ways.
              This repository will be empty for a while.  One day I'd love to collaborate and learn from others.
